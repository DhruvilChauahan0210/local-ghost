## Phase 5: Advanced Performance Engineering — ✅ Complete

## Phase 6: Runtime Hardening & Security Architecture — ✅ Complete

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| Deep-freeze input data clone | ✅ Done | `Object.freeze(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data)))` — generated code cannot mutate source dataset |
| Exported from package root | ✅ Done | `safelyExecuteGeneratedCode` and `verifyCodeSafety` available as named exports |
| `QUERY_ERROR` / `JSON_ERROR` / `ANALYSIS_ERROR` message types | ✅ Done | Inference-level failures no longer kill `ai.status` — only the failed request is rejected |
| All promise rejections use `new Error()` | ✅ Done | Fixes "Unknown error" in catch blocks that checked `err instanceof Error` |
| Worker array-return validation | ✅ Done | `new Function` test now checks `Array.isArray(testResult)` — catches code that returns `.length` or scalar |

---

## Phase 7: Advanced UX & Interaction Layers — ✅ Complete

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `<SmartDataGrid>` row animations | ✅ Done | CSS `@keyframes lgRowIn` (fade + translateY) injected once per document, 18ms stagger per row on filter |
| `<SmartForm>` confidence badges | ✅ Done | Color-coded per-field badges after extraction — green ≥86%, yellow 62–78%, red ≤54% with red border |
| Confidence badges clear on manual edit | ✅ Done | Badge removed from individual field when user manually edits its value |
| `<SmartAnalytics>` voice input | ✅ Done | `webkitSpeechRecognition` mic button — auto-populates query + triggers generation on speech result |
| Voice input hidden when unsupported | ✅ Done | Button only renders when browser supports Speech API |
| `<SmartDataGrid>` stat card | ✅ Done | When AI returns a scalar (count, avg), renders an emerald stat card instead of crashing |

---

## Phase 8: Monorepo Polish & Distribution — ✅ Complete

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Package version → 1.0.0 | ✅ Done | Published to npm as `@dhruvil0210/local-ghost@1.0.0` |
| `vite.config.ts` sourcemaps | ✅ Done | `sourcemap: true` |
| Production minification | ✅ Done | `minify: 'esbuild'`, `esbuild.drop: ['console', 'debugger']` — zero dev traces in prod bundles |
| Package `name` corrected | ✅ Done | `'LocalGhost'` in lib config |
| Clean conditional exports | ✅ Done | ESM + CJS + types all correctly wired in package.json `exports` field |

---

## v1.1.0 Release — ✅ Complete (published 2026-05-21)

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `analyzeData()` context method | ✅ Done | 4 action types: `chart`, `table`, `stat`, `filter` |
| `AnalysisResult` type exported | ✅ Done | Full interface covering all action shapes |
| `executeAnalysis()` never returns null | ✅ Done | All paths have defaults — `inferFields()` from real data types, safe fallbacks for every missing field |
| `normalizeResult()` in worker | ✅ Done | Fills every missing field the model forgets — infers `metric` from label/query text, `field` from schema hints, `action` from other present keys |
| `ruleBasedAnalysis()` engine | ✅ Done | 15+ regex patterns: who earns most, youngest/oldest, avg/sum/max/min X, top N, bottom N, how many, count by X, avg X by Y, scatter X vs Y, sort by X, show/filter X |
| Rule-based runs before LLM | ✅ Done | Common patterns resolved instantly without inference; LLM result used if rule-based returns null |
| Scatter chart type | ✅ Done | `type: 'scatter'` — raw XY data, Recharts `ScatterChart`, labelled axes, no aggregation |
| Stat card with record detail | ✅ Done | For max/min stats, shows the matching full row (name, role, salary, etc.) below the big number |
| Ranked table with `#` column | ✅ Done | `table` action shows rank column when `sortBy` is set |
| `ANALYSIS_ERROR` message type | ✅ Done | Analytics failures keep AI status as `ready` |
| Demo app comprehensive bug sweep | ✅ Done | See bug-fixes section below |
| Package synced to demo quality | ✅ Done | All worker, context, component improvements applied to `packages/smart-data-grid/src/` |
| Published to npm | ✅ Done | `@dhruvil0210/local-ghost@1.1.0` |

---

## Demo App Bug Fixes (2026-05-21) — ✅ Complete

| Bug | Fix | Component |
|---|---|---|
| "AI Unavailable" after one bad query | `QUERY_ERROR` type — AI stays `ready`, only the request fails | Worker + Context |
| "Unknown error" instead of real message | All rejections use `new Error(msg)` instead of raw strings | Context |
| "show only engineers" not matching | Added `show only X`, `only X`, `filter X`, `find X`, bare-noun patterns with `.includes()` | Worker |
| AIStatusBadge breaks flex layout during loading | Compact inline pill during loading; `TerminalLogPanel` extracted as separate component | AIStatusBadge |
| Auto-fill button clickable before AI ready | Added `ai.status !== 'ready'` to disabled condition | SmartForm |
| "did not produce an array" crash | Worker validates `Array.isArray(testResult)`, not just no-throw; component shows stat card for scalars | Worker + SmartDataGrid |
| Scatter chart "unrecognized action" | Prompt updated with scatter examples; action normalized from `type` field when `action` missing | Worker |
| Any query crashing SmartAnalytics | `executeAnalysis` never returns null; infers all missing fields from real data | SmartAnalytics |
| Version badges showing v0.1.0 | Updated to v1.0.0 / v1.1.0 everywhere | All |

| Analytics Action Types section | ✅ Done | 4 cards (STAT/TABLE/CHART/FILTER) with example queries and output shapes |
| Architecture section | ✅ Done | WebGPU acceleration, security sandbox, VRAM management |
| Package name corrected | ✅ Done | `@dhruvil0210/local-ghost` throughout (was `local-ghost`) |
| `analyzeData()` code block | ✅ Done | Direct API usage example added to install section |
| Responsive CSS | ✅ Done | changelog + action-grid collapse to 1 column on mobile |

## Next Up

| Task | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Interactive CodeSandbox / StackBlitz embeds | Medium | Phase 2 carry-over |

| Enterprise tier / pricing page | Low | Phase 4 carry-over |
| Unit tests for `executeAnalysis` and `ruleBasedAnalysis` | Medium | Critical paths now stable enough to pin |
| `useAnalytics()` standalone hook | Low | Convenience wrapper around `analyzeData` for headless use cases |
